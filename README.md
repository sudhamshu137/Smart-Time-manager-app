A simple app for the smart time management of the users.</br>
Due to the covid, most of the people are working from home so they might be lacking the better time management they used to when things were normal.
This app sends notifications for the users to alert and make them aware of the next work that they have to be covering. Not only this, the user can set his own timetable to 
follow while the app has a default time table to follow. This allows the user to get notifications of the pending works, upcoming deadline. The user can also set a reminder in the app to 
get the notification at the required time. To make it more natural, the app sends tips to the user for the betterment of their life. Examples include sending the tips to exercise. to get 
a coffee, to have lunch, to take a break while intensed working pressure, to send some jokes random, to direct the user keep a healthy environment around and much much more.
